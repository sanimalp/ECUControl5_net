This is the source code for ECUControl. This code was adapted from http://forum.pgmfi.org Open ECUControl project. The major changes were a conversion from vb6 to vb.net, and the removal of the proprietary guage package. 

The install folder contains a binary executable that requires the .net platform be installed on the machine in order to operate.  This binary is the one built from the contents of the source folder.
